Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This weight loss application was designed to address users who desired to record their body weight on a daily basis, keep a grid view of their body weights with coinciding dates recorded, and enter a weight goal. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? 

The requirements included a log in with a password, registration for new user, ability to record, delete or modify entries, set a goal, and give permissions to receive sms text notification upon completing the goal. 

How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

They are easily navigated and easy to view using industry standards for appearance and lay out. They succeeded due to ease of use and ability to work as intended, without bugs or crashing. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app?

I approach all projects slowly and with caution, using critical thinking to lay out all of the user needs and all of the app requirements prior to coding anything. Most of the brain work is done on the front end with the coding to follow.

What techniques or strategies did you use? 

Thoroughly reading, understanding requirements, and having a good perception of the vision are all techniques that I use and believe are very helpful to succeed.

How could those be applied in the future?

All of the aforementioned techniques not only help in application projects, but in most areas of life. Having a thorough and thoughtful understanding of what is being asked is imperative to succeed and communicate. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional?
I used the simulator and ran the code multiple times with use cases to ensure it was working properly.

Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
The process is important because error free code does not guarantee that the user will not run into issues with certain use cases. It is helpful to try to think of all the scenarios in which the app can fail to ensure that it does not. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Personally I was very frustrated with the grid table design in Android studio. Unlike xcode, there did not seem to be an easy way to integrate and populate the table with the information and much of it had to be done manually. I'm not sure that I innovated but made it work to my liking. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Even though I am highly inexperienced I believe that I was particularly successful in understanding the requirements and delivering them exactly as requested. Completing the grid view and having a pleasant appearance was a personal success for me.
